''' 2-10. Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and  add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write  because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and  the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence  describing what the program does. '''
